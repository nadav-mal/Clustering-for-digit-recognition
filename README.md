# Clustering-for-digit-recognition
Using clustering methods to classify digits from Mnist dataset </br>
Overview
This project aims to classify digits from the MNIST784 dataset using various clustering methods.<br>
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features.</br>
In this project, we will apply different clustering algorithms to identify patterns and similarities in the digit images,</br>
effectively categorizing them into distinct clusters.<br>

Dataset</br>
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST784 dataset, which consists of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.</br>
Each image is represented as a flattened array of 784 pixel values, and the corresponding labels indicate the actual digit the image represents.</br>
